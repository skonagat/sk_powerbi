4 csv files were considered (Company Territory Lookup, Company Product Lookup, Company Product Categories Lookup and Company Product subcategories Lookup).
Renamed queries to Territory Lookup, Product Lookup, Product Categories Lookup and Product subcategories Lookup respectively.
Data types were analysed across all columns in all csv files.
Added new column in Product Lookup csv by extrcating all characters before first "-" from the Product SKU column.
